In this assignment we went back to a previous project our Top Spots website and updated it. We were tasked to create an API in Visual Studios that returns a JSON array on top spots in the same format as the file given in TopSpotsAngular and modify our Angular factory to call our new API instead of the JSON file from the file system. It was a good project to go back and apply new techniques learned in using C# to create our own API and testing it on Postman. This project allowed me to get good experience with CRUD methods and how it works.
